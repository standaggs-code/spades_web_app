♠️ Spades Scorekeeper: Host Guide
🚀 Getting Started
Enter Names: Type all 4 player names in the setup screen.

Pick First Dealer: Use the dropdown to select who starts with the cards.

Set Your Rules: * Goal: 250 (Short) or 500 (Standard).

Bag Limit: 10 bags is standard; 5 bags makes the game much more "punishing."

Set Limit: If a team fails their bid 3 times (or 2, depending on your choice), they lose instantly.

Randomize: Hit "Randomize & Start" to let the app pick the teams (Partner 1 & 3 vs Partner 2 & 4).

📝 Recording Hands
Bid/Got: Enter the team's total bid and the total tricks they actually took.

Nil Bids: If a player goes Nil, check the Nil? box and enter how many tricks that specific player took.

The app automatically subtracts the Nil tricks from the team total to see if the partner "covered" the bid.

Undo: Made a mistake? Hit Undo Last Round to revert the score and the dealer icon.

🏠 House Rules (Hardcoded Logic)
Bags: Each bag is +1 point. Reaching the Bag Limit results in a penalty of -50 or -100 points (resets bags to zero).

The "Set Out" Rule: If a team fails their bid (or fails a Nil) twice in a row OR 3 times total, the game ends immediately and the other team wins.

Dealer Rotation: The 🃏 icon moves clockwise every hand. If you undo a hand, the dealer icon moves back.

🏆 Career Stats & Leaderboard
Persistence: All wins and losses are saved to the device.

Win %: The Leaderboard ranks players by their efficiency (Wins/Games).

Dark Mode: Use the 🌙 icon at night to save your eyes.

Exporting: Click "Export Results" at the end of a game to copy a full play-by-play to your clipboard for the group chat.
